	<h1>About Tarteel Al Quran</h1>
	
	<p> Tarteel Al Quran is about getting together and being able to finish the Quran in Ramadaan. We will read
	one Juz per day, every day for 30 days. Everyday 3 different people will share any lesson they learned from
	the juz we read that day. There will be about 20 people in the class so everyone will read one page. To make the flow
	of the class easy we will assign everybody a number and we will read in that same order everyday. If you click the Student tab
	all the students names will be posted, when you click on your name it will show what page you are assigned
	everyday until the end.</p>
